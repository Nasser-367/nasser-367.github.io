        A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At
        small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum
        computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot
        explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could
        perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern “classical” computer. In
        particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely-used encryption schemes
        and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art
        is still largely experimental and impractical.

          The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in
          traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of
          its two “basis” states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When
          measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum
          computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify
          the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating
          procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is
          not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence,
          introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in
          experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times
          and lower error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors
          (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps
          (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).
        </p>

        <p>
          Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved
          by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum
          computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough
          time. In other words, quantum computers obey the Church–Turing thesis. This means
          that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers
          in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain problems have significantly
          lower time complexities than corresponding known classical algorithms.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct
          academic communities. Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain the
          wave-particle duality observed at atomic scales, and digital computers emerged in the
          following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.

      <div class="col" id="algorithms">
        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
          Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on the quantum circuit model,
          though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be
          roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical
          algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known
          classical algorithm include Shor’s algorithm for factoring and the related quantum
          algorithms for computing discrete logarithms.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer.
          Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these requirements for a practical quantum
          computer:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits</li>
          <li>Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values</li>
          <li>Quantum gates that are faster than decoherence time</li>
          <li>Universal gate set</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum
          theory to describe a simplified computer. When digital computers became faster,
          physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,
          prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to suggest that quantum hardware might be
          more efficient for simulation.

      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          These algorithms depend on primitives like the quantum Fourier transform. Certain
          oracle problems like Simon’s problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give
          provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model and doesn’t necessarily
          translate to practical speedups for real-world problems.

      <div class="col">

          The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large
          number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. Scaling these
          systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.
        </p>

        <h3>Decoherence</h3>
        <p>
          One of the greatest challenges involved with constructing quantum computers is
          controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system
          from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to
          decohere.

        <h3>Quantum supremacy</h3>
        <p>
          Quantum supremacy is a term coined by John Preskill referring to the engineering feat of
          demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the
          capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers. The problem need not be useful, so
          some view the test only as a potential future benchmark.

      <div class="col">
        <h3>Skepticism</h3>
        <p>
          Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum computers could
          ever be built, typically because of noise, error correction overhead, and the difficulty of
          maintaining long coherence times in large systems.

          <h3>Computability</h3>
          <p>
            Any computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a
            quantum computer. Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena,
            including the operation of classical computers, can be described using quantum
            mechanics, which underlies the operation of quantum computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical
            computer, at least in principle given enough time.

          <h3>Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot
            already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical
            computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently factor
            integers, while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.
